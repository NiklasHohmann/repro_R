# Workshop description

This file provides a brief overview of the workshop "Open and Reproducible Science in R and RStudio"

## Audience and duration

The workshop can be held for mixed audiences, ranging from undergraduate students with little experience in R to researchers familiar with R, but not familiar with Open Science practices in R. The minimum requirement is that participants can write and modify basic R code and install new R packages.

The workshop duration is approx. 4h, including breaks.

## Preliminaries

Participants should bring their own coding project to work on during the workshop. If they do not have one, they can work on the example code (`example/code.R`) and dummy data (`example/dummy_data.csv`) provided. This code is not a fully fledged scientific analysis, but designed to be a good example of all the topics covered in the workshop. As such, it is intentionally simple.

The slides (under `slides/`) should be shared with participants before the workshop so they have access to all materials and resources while working independently.

## Structure

The workshop is subdivided into four parts, each approx 1h long:

1.  Introduction and structure
2.  Code and computation
3.  Licenses, archiving, and publication
4.  Peer-feedback and advanced topics

Each of the blocks starts with 10 minutes lecture based on the provided slides. Afterwards, participants solve the provided task using the material provided on the slides (25 to 30 minutes). This is followed by 5 minutes of discussion on pitfalls and problems encountered. Then participants get 10 to 15 minutes break. During the break, the instructor can troubleshoot issues encountered by individual participants.

The peer-feedback is intended for groups of 4 to 5 participants, with 20 minutes to review the code and 10 minutes of discussion.
