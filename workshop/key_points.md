# Key points

Key points covered in the workshop:

1.  Start from a clean slate - don't save your workspace

8.  If you're using random numbers, set the seed of the RNG
9.  Replace magic numbers by constants with meaningful names
10. Use reproducible environments (e.g., via `renv`) to keep track of package and software versions
11. Cite scientific software in your articles
12. Use identifiers (DOI, ORCID) wherever possible
13. Cite your code in your publications
14. Choose an appropriate license
15. Archive your code and assign it a DOI
16. Provide a lot of metadata
